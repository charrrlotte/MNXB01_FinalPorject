3.1 The temperature of a given day:
-make histogram
-return staDev
-return mean
-setup function such that it can be called by next two functions form similar to:
Double_t func(file,date,plot=1){
if (plot = 1)
  plot
return([mean,staDev]) //vector format or something
}

3.2 The temperature for every day of the year: Martin Waites
-run previous for all days,
-plot


Our result: Martin Waites
- we intend on comparing the 3.2 results from different places dependant on latitude.
-reuse cod from 3.2
-run first for all days for chosen files
-plot multiple
